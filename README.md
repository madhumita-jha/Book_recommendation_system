# Book Recommendation System Using Sentiment Analysis

The Book Recommendation System uses sentiment analysis to recommend books based on the user’s mood and genre preference. Built with Flask for the backend and TextBlob for sentiment analysis, this system provides personalized book recommendations. The book data can be dynamically fetched from Kaggle using KaggleHub.

## Features
- **Sentiment-Based Recommendations**: Recommends books based on the user’s mood (e.g., happy, sad) using sentiment analysis.
- **Genre Filtering**: Allows users to specify a genre for more tailored book suggestions.
- **Dynamic Book Suggestions**: Selects books from a large dataset, dynamically filtered by mood and genre.
- **API for Frontend Integration**: Can be integrated with a frontend built using frameworks like **ReactJS**.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask, Python
- **Sentiment Analysis**: TextBlob
- **Data Fetching**: KaggleHub (for downloading datasets from Kaggle)
- **API**: JSON, RESTful API
- **Database**: Pandas (for handling the book dataset)
